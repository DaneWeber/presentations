Gene Kim's Three Ways of DevOps:

1. The first way is about the left-to-right flow of work from Development to IT Operations to the customer.
2. The second way is about the constant flow of fast feedback from right-to-left at all stages of the value stream.
3. The third way is about creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.



Management 3.0

1. Build for meaning
2. Innovate management
3. Accelerate learning
4. Run experiments
5. Embrace playfulness
6. Nurture happiness
7. Manage the system



Gene Kim's Five Ideals:
From the Unicorn Project

1. Locality and Simplicity
2. Focus, Flow, and Joy
3. Improvement of Daily Work
4. Psychological Safety
5. Customer Focus


## The First Ideal—Locality and Simplicity.

- Congruent architecture and organization that minimizes hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination.
- Also applies to code organization and data movement.
- Reduce complexity to reduce risk and waste.


## The Second Ideal—Focus, Flow, and Joy.

- Rapidly go from idea to a change in production.
- Work within the problem-space, rather than with tangential matters that get in the way.
- Have a great time doing so.
- It helps to automate routine activities and get rapid feedback on work.


## The Third Ideal—Improvement of Daily Work.

- Stop the production line and make things better.
- It is more important to improve how we work now than just get work done.
- Improve as individual people; improve relationships; improve processes; improve tools; improve technology.
- Pay down technical debt by investing in technical excellence.


## The Fourth Ideal—Psychological Safety.

- Take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed.
- Say, “I don’t know.”- Continuously learning.
- New ideas are welcomed.
- Failure is done in the open, examined blamelessly, and leads to growth.
- This is the biggest predictor of a team’s success.


## The Fifth Ideal—Customer Focus.

- Go learn what real users/customers/stakeholders need.
- Prioritize core over context, which means doing the things that provide the real value.
- This isn’t just one specialist’s job: we each need to understand the “why” of what we are doing so that we can make good trade-offs.



# Agile Operating System


Software is about creative problem-solving. Once we are done learning, we've solved the problem. If we're doing the exact same thing again, we should copy-paste or automate it. Improving software delivery is fundamentally about improving the quality and rapidity of the feedback loops.


Optimizing efficiency, as you might for digging a ditch or even an assembly line, is ineffective at improving software delivery.

1. Optimize value delivery (not work or utilization)
2. Increment -- small batches
3. Sequence -- most payoff or most learning
4. Iterate -- inspect, learn, and adapt
