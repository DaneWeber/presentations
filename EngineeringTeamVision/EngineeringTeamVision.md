## Motivated


I'm hoping for intrinsic motivation

Want to

- learn
- get better
- work together
- try new things


🛑 Let me know if there's something getting in the way of your intrinsic motivation.

🚧 I want to remove that impediment.

Doing a bad job is not an option.*


🛢 Should a mechanic give you the option of driving away without oil?

<p class="fragment">🧤 Should a doctor ask whether you want hands to be washed and all surgical tools removed after the surgery?</p>


🔩 Mechanics replacing all of the nuts and bolts, putting protective floormats in, and using funnels is just part of the deal.

<p class="fragment">🧰 As is keeping the shop floor clean, tools organized, and lift in working order.</p>

<p class="fragment">🧼 Surgeons washing their hands, retrieving all of their tools, and keeping the operating room clean is just part of the deal.</p>


👩‍💻 Writing DRY, easily understood, well-tested code is just part of the deal.

<p class="fragment">🧪 Updating dependencies, pair-programming, code reviews, refactoring, and automated tests are just part of the deal.</p>



## Make things better and better


### Five Ideals:

1. 🦠 Locality and Simplicity
2. 🎯 Focus, Flow, and Joy
3. 🔪 Improvement of Daily Work
4. ⛑ Psychological Safety
5. 🔮 Customer Focus


#### 1) 🦠 Locality and Simplicity

- Does it take 50 teams across five continents and 15 systems to coordinate to make a small change?
- Congruent architecture and organization that minimizes hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination.
- Also applies to code organization and data movement.
- Reduce complexity to reduce risk and waste.


#### 2) 🎯 Focus, Flow, and Joy

- Work within the problem-space, rather than with tangential matters that get in the way.
- Rapidly go from idea to a change in production.
- Have a great time doing so.
- It helps to automate routine activities and get rapid feedback on work.


#### 3) 🔪 Improvement of Daily Work

- Stop the production line and make things better.
- It is more important to improve how we work now than just get work done.
- Improve as individual people; improve relationships; improve processes; improve tools; improve technology.
- Pay down technical debt by investing in technical excellence.


#### 4) ⛑ Psychological Safety

- Take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed.
- Say, “I don’t know.” -- Continuously learning.
- New ideas are welcomed.
- Failure is done in the open, examined blamelessly, and leads to growth.
- This is the biggest predictor of a team’s success.


#### 5) 🔮 Customer Focus

- Go learn what real users/customers/stakeholders need.
- Prioritize core over context, which means doing the things that provide the real value.
- This isn’t just one specialist’s job: we each need to understand the “why” of what we are doing so that we can make good trade-offs.
