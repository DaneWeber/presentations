# Locality and Simplicity



## Five Ideals

1. ðŸ¦  Locality and Simplicity
2. ðŸŽ¯ Focus, Flow, and Joy
3. ðŸ”ª Improvement of Daily Work
4. â›‘ Psychological Safety
5. ðŸ”® Customer Focus


### 1) ðŸ¦  Locality and Simplicity

- Does it take 50 teams across five continents and 15 systems to coordinate to make a small change?
- Congruent architecture and organization that minimizes hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination.
- Also applies to code organization and data movement.
- Reduce complexity to reduce risk and waste.


- How can we minimize hand-offs?
- How can we avoid bottlenecks?
- How can we eliminate dependencies?



## Principles


### Conway's Law

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

â€”â€‰Melvin E. Conway

Ref: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) & [Mel Conway's site](http://melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html)


Move toward an organizational shape and software architecture that best aligns with the mission and serves your customers and stakeholders.

### Hackman's Law

> The larger a group, the more process problems members encounter in carrying out their collective workâ€¦. Worse, the vulnerability of a group to such difficulties increases sharply as size increases.

Software development has [diseconomies of scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseconomies_of_scale), the most obvious of which is the geometric growth of communication channels.

Avoid scaling if possible. See the first two principles of the [Manifesto for Scaling Agility](https://scalingmanifesto.org/):

1. If you can achieve your goals with a single team, do not scale. Employ the minimum number of people required to meet your strategic outcomes.
2. If you have a single team and it cannot deliver effectively using Agile principles and practices, do not scale. Succeed with a single team first.

### Value Delivery

1. Teamsâ€”Ideally a single team can deliver business value by itself, avoiding hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination overhead. <span style="color: grey">(cross-functional feature teamsâ€¦)</span>
2. Codeâ€”Ideally the change can be made in a single place, avoiding repetition, dependencies, and unfamiliar code. <span style="color: grey">(DRY, decoupled, well-architected codeâ€¦)</span>

### Operations and Maintenance

1. Teamsâ€”Ideally a team owns a service and can rewrite it on their own authority, avoiding committees and campaigning. <span style="color: grey">(internal APIs, microservicesâ€¦)</span>
2. Codeâ€”Ideally there is a single version of the code running everywhere, avoiding merge conflicts, incompatibilities, and environment-specific issues. <span style="color: grey">(continuous integration, trunk-based development, continuous delivery/deployment, etc.)</span>
