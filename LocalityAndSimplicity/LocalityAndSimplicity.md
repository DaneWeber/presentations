# Locality and Simplicity



## Five Ideals

1. ðŸ¦  Locality and Simplicity
2. ðŸŽ¯ Focus, Flow, and Joy
3. ðŸ”ª Improvement of Daily Work
4. â›‘ Psychological Safety
5. ðŸ”® Customer Focus



#### 1) ðŸ¦  Locality and Simplicity

- Does it take 50 teams across five continents and 15 systems to coordinate to make a small change?
- Congruent architecture and organization that minimizes hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination.
- Also applies to code organization and data movement.
- Reduce complexity to reduce risk and waste.


- How can we minimize hand-offs?
- How can we avoid bottlenecks?
- There is risk and waste in coordinating or "managing" dependencies.


- Code change in one place (decoupled architecture, well-designed DRY code)
- Made by one team (cross-functional value-delivery teams)
- One version of the code everywhere (trunk-based development, CI, Cd, CD)


### Conway's Law

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

â€”â€‰Melvin E. Conway

### Hackman's Law

> The larger a group, the more process problems members encounter in carrying out their collective workâ€¦. Worse, the vulnerability of a group to such difficulties increases sharply as size increases.

## Reduce complexity to reduce risk and waste


### Value Delivery

1. Teamsâ€”Ideally a single team can deliver business value by itself, avoiding hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination overhead.
2. Codeâ€”Ideally the change can be made in a single place, avoiding repetition, dependencies, and unfamiliar code.


### Operations and Maintenance

1. Teamsâ€”Ideally a team owns a service and can rewrite it on their own authority, avoiding committees and campaigning.
2. Codeâ€”Ideally there is only a single version of the code running everywhere, avoiding merge conflicts, incompatibilities, and environment-specific issues.
