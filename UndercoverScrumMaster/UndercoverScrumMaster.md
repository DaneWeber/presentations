# Undercover Scrum Master


* Software development since 2009 (PO, BA, AO, etc.).
* Part-time Scrum Master starting in 2013.
* Full-time Scrum Master/Agile Coach from January 2016 until...
* Ruby developer on Scrum team starting August 2017.

## Writing code = fun

feedback loops are gratifying


### Fun feedback loops

* seeing someone use the software
* demoing to a stakeholder
* tester approval
* seeing the software work
* getting automated tests to pass


### Test-Driven Development

feels really good, when it flows

---

## Testing infrastructure <br/> != <br/> fun


### Infrastructure is a necessary chore

* it's easier when it grows with the product
* testing a simple function is simple
* testing the whole application isn't bad, once you figure out your testing framework
* tests in the middle are the messiest


### Messy tests

* test doubles (mocks) helps run tests more quickly (good) and with a narrower focus (also good)
* test doubles requires knowing about how remote parts of the application work
* figuring out the required test doubles for poorly-tested existing code is a royal pain
* poorly tested code discourages new tests

## Implicitly in a hurry

unauthorized technical debt


### Velocity/Cycle Time

* of course we want to deliver more faster always
* POs and stakeholders only ask for more faster
* quality only seems to matter when a defect escapes
* it's hard to communicate how code quality needs to be improved
* writing high-quality code can end up being a matter of self-discipline with minimal support


### Recommendations for better quality

* clearly communicate the team's commitment not to cut corners
* shield the team from hurry-up talk
* be very clear when an immediate band-aid is needed, to be followed later by a good fix
* taking on technical debt should be rare and only when explicitly demanded in writing by the PO

---

## Cognitive load

we get tired


### So much to know and think about

* so many tools, languages, & responsibilities
* need to know business, technology, and process

---

## Big picture paradox


* need the big picture for executive decision-making
* want early input to avoid bad path dependency
* also want to focus on the work-at-hand (fun feedback loops)

---

## "Pairing," pairing, and Pairing


* full pairing takes infrastructure and courage
* not intuitive and probably not comfortable

---

## Bonus: the CSD

* three days
* hands-on TDD
* all about automated tests
* SOLID design principles
* Clean code
* a little about pairing
