## Sweet Spot

If you can find a job that 
* You enjoy
* You're good at
* Pays well

**Do that.**



Computer programming pays well, so if you enjoy it and are good at it, it could fit in that sweet spot.



Even if you're not passionate about it, computer programming can provide a career that
* Pays for your passion projects
* Provides a flexible schedule, including the ability to work from home
* Can serve as a back-up since it is not physically demanding and can be performed with impairments



The ability to write software will serve you in other settings if you pursue another career. You might
* figure out how to automate tedious parts of your job
* improve a web site or how your computer works
* better understand the custom software others write for your work
* see through misleading statements about computer technology
