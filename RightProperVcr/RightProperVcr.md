# Right Proper VCR


Testing is a feedback loop.


Feedback loops are better when they are
- Relevant
- Low-Latency


Relavance:
- Fail where the real system fails
- Succeed where the real system succeeds
- Low noise/false positives
- Important failures look important


Low-Latency:
- Instant feedback is the ideal
- Delays in each stage of the feedback loop degrade the relevance
