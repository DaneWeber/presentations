#### 1) ðŸ¦  Locality and Simplicity

- Does it take 50 teams across five continents and 15 systems to coordinate to make a small change?
- Congruent architecture and organization that minimizes hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination.
- Also applies to code organization and data movement.
- Reduce complexity to reduce risk and waste.



- Code change in one place (decoupled architecture, well-designed DRY code)
- Made by one team (cross-functional value-delivery teams)
- One version of the code everywhere (trunk-based development, CI, Cd, CD)


- Avoid hand-offs & bottlenecks.
- There is risk and waste in coordinating dependencies.
