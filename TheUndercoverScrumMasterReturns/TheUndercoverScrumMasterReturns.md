# The Undercover Scrum Master Returns

Note: TODO



## Intro & Assumptions

Note: 0:00 Intro & Assumptions


### Dane's undercover mission

Note: TODO


#### Previous Experience

- Philosophy & Clinical Psychology
- Business Analysis, Support, Account Ownership
- Product Owner & Scrum Master
- Agile Coach

Note: TODO
The leadup to my undercover mission. Narrate.
Psychology -> Custom Software world -> Discovered Scrum and Agile -> wanted to coach on development practices


#### The Mission

🟥E-Verify⬜

🐳 Big Sillies
🦊 Faux Pas
👾 Bits, Please!

Note:
- Worked with a high-performing set of teams
- where we were able to have fun, name our teams
- We experimented and looked for ways to improve
- The project was characterized by egalitarian, joyful, empowered, and helpful people
- Was really surprised by what I learned from the experience


#### The Return

- Technical Agile Coach
- Engineering Manager
- Software Developer (again)

Note:
Since then I've sought out opportunities to participate in sofware development from micro to macro, writing code to organizational design.
Unfortunately, most jobs and roles are designed to box you in, so I keep looking for roles that allow me to develop my technical skills while also having the opportunity to improve the work environment.


### Baseline Assumptions


#### Agile Manifesto

Agility > ~Efficiency~

Note: TODO
While I'm more than happy to discuss the Agile Manfesto, I'm going to speak as though we're all already on-board with it.


#### Humanity and being humane

Note: TODO
I want the workplace to be humane. I'm not interested in helping anyone exploit workers.


#### Sustainable pace

Note: TODO
Same deal, but here I'll speak to this later on. I'm personally biased in favor of a reasonable work-week approached thoughtfully. I believe that's also how to develop the best software, but I'm definitely biased in favor.



## Crossing the Technical Divide

Note: 0:06 Crossing the Technical Divide


You don't need to spend two years programming.

Note: TODO
If you don't consider yourself technical, I want to encourage you to bravely work with your colleagues regardless of expertise. I certainly gained valuable insight and a lot of confidence by engaging in software development myself, but in retrospect I don't believe it was necessary.


### Keys

Collegiality -> Empathy -> Curiosity -> Advocacy -> Challenge

Note: TODO
Here's my bottom-line for this presention.
When approaching your technical colleagues, I'm hoping you can develop these traits and skills.
You could add "technical" to each of these terms if you like.


## Collegiality

Note: 0:08 Collegiality


collegiality

1. working with colleagues in an effective and cooperative manner
2. power and authority that is shared among peers

Note:
By this I mean that you should treat software developers and other folks engaged in technical jobs as your peers.

Note: TODO

Caring about the same thing: racing team

Note: TODO
* If you consider a professional racing team, you'll see that the driver and the pit crew are all working toward the same goal.
* They're all professionals, and they all care about the same thing.


ACTIVITY:

write out one thing you can change that you've done in the past to reinforce the technical divide.

Leave it for me at the end of the talk.

Understanding the programmers

Note: TODO
Story: as a scrum master I assumed the best of the members of my team, but I had a hard time understanding some of their preferences and behaviors. Why weren't they more excited about digging into our process and improving how we worked together? They seemed to want to just get on with the work.
