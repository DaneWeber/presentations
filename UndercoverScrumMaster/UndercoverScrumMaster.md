# Undercover Scrum Master



## Writing code = fun

feedback loops are gratifying

* seeing someone use the software
* demoing to a stakeholder
* tester approval
* seeing the software work
* getting automated tests to pass



## Testing infrastructure !=&nbsp;fun



## Implicitly in a hurry

unauthorized technical debt


We need time to refactor



## Cognitive load - we get tired



## "Pairing," pairing, and Pairing



## Big picture paradox
