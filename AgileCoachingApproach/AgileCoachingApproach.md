# Agile Coaching

Dane Weber



I'm here to coach.


There are many expectations for "Scrum Master" and "Agile Coach."
<p class="fragment">There are also many ways of _being_ those things.</p>
<p class="fragment">What do you expect of a coach?</p>


"A good Scrum Master is always on the verge of being fired." --Ken Schwaber


My responsibility is to help improve:

- Organization
- Product Owner
- Team
- Technical Practices

I should not be essential to the value stream's operation.

<p class="fragment">My focus is improving how the work is done</p>


Think of a football or soccer coach: I'm not on the field. I'm observing and advising.

I don't have silver bullets, I have feedback loops:

- transparency -> inspection -> adaptation
- reduce latency, reduce noise, increase frequency, increase signal
- building the right thing & building the thing right & how
- code, tests, logging, monitoring, alerting, resilience, plans, business value, stakeholder satisfaction, user behavior, team collaboration, etc. 



I expect the team to be responsible, motivated, and disciplined



Freedom and Responsibility


The Rare Responsible Person

- Self disciplined
- Self improving
- Acts like a leader
- Doesn't wait to be told what to do

[Also from the Netflix Culture slide deck:](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/42-Responsible_PeopleThrive_on_Freedomand_are)

Responsible People **Thrive** on Freedom, and are **Worthy** of Freedom



Motivated


I'm hoping for intrinsic motivation

See [Dan Pink's "Drive"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)


Autonomy - self-direction and having a say

Mastery - working on things that push you to grow

Purpose - contribute to something meaningful


Want to
- learn
- get better
- work together
- try new things



Disciplined Professionalism


You are trusted to act in the best interests of our clients.

Do it the right way. Do it well.


There are often options, and we should present those with trade-offs everyone can understand.


Do you want a washable K&N air filter? Or just stick to the standard disposable air filters?

Doing a bad job is not an option.*


Should a mechanic give you the option of driving away without oil?

Should a doctor ask whether you want hands to be washed and all surgical tools  removed after the surgery?

Keeping the shop floor and operating room clean and organized is just part of the deal.



I want to make things better and better


Five Ideals:

1. Locality and Simplicity
2. Focus, Flow, and Joy
3. Improvement of Daily Work
4. Psychological Safety
5. Customer Focus


1) Locality and Simplicity

- Does it take 50 teams across five continents and 15 systems to coordinate to make a small change?
- Congruent architecture and organization that minimizes hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination.
- Also applies to code organization and data movement.
- Reduce complexity to reduce risk and waste.


2) Focus, Flow, and Joy

- Work within the problem-space, rather than with tangential matters that get in the way.
- Rapidly go from idea to a change in production.
- Have a great time doing so.
- It helps to automate routine activities and get rapid feedback on work.


3) Improvement of Daily Work

- Stop the production line and make things better.
- It is more important to improve how we work now than just get work done.
- Improve as individual people; improve relationships; improve processes; improve tools; improve technology.
- Pay down technical debt by investing in technical excellence.


4) Psychological Safety

- Take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed.
- Say, “I don’t know.” -- Continuously learning.
- New ideas are welcomed.
- Failure is done in the open, examined blamelessly, and leads to growth.
- This is the biggest predictor of a team’s success.


5) Customer Focus

- Go learn what real users/customers/stakeholders need.
- Prioritize core over context, which means doing the things that provide the real value.
- This isn’t just one specialist’s job: we each need to understand the “why” of what we are doing so that we can make good trade-offs.


What else should we improve?



What to expect


- One-on-ones
- Pair-programming and mob-programming
- Tools and automation
- Learning sessions
- Retrospectives
- Questions, advice, proposals
- Meeting facilitation

Are these okay with you?
