Learning Outcome
Understand the pros and cons of "modernization" efforts and the alternative of in-place renovation.

Gain insight about a software system that was continually renovated by a team that didn't know it was Agile.

The federal government loves modernizing software systems and it isn't wrong: stale, decaying software leads to major headaches and eventual catastrophe. Modernization efforts, however, have big risks and big failures.

There is an alternative: software renovation. That is improving, updating, and upgrading the software system one piece at a time while it continues to operate.

Dane has participated deeply in three US government modernization projects. Each project followed a pattern of pitfalls, scary "go-live" transitions, and unpleasant trade-offs.

Renovating legacy software is frequently a better option. The software system continues to gain functionality at the same time that its design and performance are improved.
