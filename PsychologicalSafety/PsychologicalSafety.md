## Safety Culture


This comes from safety-critical work:

- Nuclear Plants
- Airplanes
- Tanker ships


### Three Mile Island<br />(Nuclear Plant Incident)

- 28 March 1979
- The most significant accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history.
- Many important factors involved, including the design of monitoring and alerting telemetry as well as poor operator training.
- Based on an incident in 1977, an operator warned about the possibility of what happened at Three Mile Island over one year before and provided recommendations for passing on knowledge and training to future operators. No action was taken.


- The GPU Service Corporation (GPUSC) was responsible for the plant design, but knew that it lacked the staff or expertise in certain areas to discharge that responsibility. Once construction was complete, GPUSC turned the plant over to Met Ed to run, but Met Ed did not have sufficient knowledge, expertise, and personnel to operate the plant or maintain it adequately.


- Management permitted many alarms to be ignored and many instruments to remain out of service.
- The control room had serious design flaws and deficiencies. After an April 1978 incident, a control room operator complained to his superiors about problems with the control room. No corrective action was taken by the utility.


### Korean Air Flight 801<br />(Airplane Crash)

- 6 August 1997
- 229 deaths
- As always, there are many factors, including fatigue, training, outdated maps, and more.


- The flight crew suggested to the captain that he was making a mistake with his approach. They did not directly warn him.
- The first officer and flight engineer were required to challenge the captain if concerned, but did not, even though they were concerned.
- The crew finally objected six seconds before the crash.
- The first officer had the ability to take over the controls and abort the landing, but allowed the captain to continue flying, even during the final six seconds.


### Torrey Canyon<br />(Oil Tanker Spill)

- 19 February 1967
- Biggest oil spill to that point.
- Captain was under pressure to make port before the tides went out to avoid costly delays.
- He set a course and went to sleep.


- The first officer allowed the ship to drift off-course. He noticed shortly before waking the captain and adjusted direction slightly, but not enough to fully correct.
- Upon being awoken, the captain chose a dangerous route close to the deadly "Seven Stones," which appeared to him to be the quickest route to the port.
- A junior officer responsible for tracking the ship's location knew something was off with his calculations, but hoped to he could get the next ones right and nobody would notice.


- The captain didn't slow down and nobody spoke up until they were almost to the rocks.
- The junior officer didn't feel safe to admit his mistake, the first officer didn't feel safe to correct his mistake, and the captain didn't feel safe to take a safe time and route to the port, or object to being over-loaded.


### Safety Culture

Don't be afraid to: 

- Admit your limitations and mistakes.
- Speak up when you notice something.
- Challenge others, including managers, experts, and other senior personnel.



## Safe to Innovate


Google studied their teams to find what ingredients led to effectiveness and high-performing teams. They found five main factors, one of which was psychological safety.

> [Psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety) is being able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status, or career.


>Psychological safety was far and away the most important of the five dynamics we found -- it’s the underpinning of the other four. How could that be? Taking a risk around your team members seems simple.


>But remember the last time you were working on a project. Did you feel like you could ask what the goal was without the risk of sounding like you’re the only one out of the loop? Or did you opt for continuing without clarifying anything, in order to avoid being perceived as someone who is unaware?


>Turns out, we’re all reluctant to engage in behaviors that could negatively influence how others perceive our competence, awareness, and positivity.


[Benefits of Psychological Safety:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety#Benefits)

- Improves likelihood that an attempted process innovation will be successful.
- Increases amount members learn from mistakes.
- Boosts employee engagement.
- Improves team innovation.


What psychological safety looks like:

- Take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed.
- Say, “I don’t know.”
- Everyone is learning.
- New ideas are welcomed.
- Failure is done in the open, examined blamelessly, and leads to growth.


Advice from Google for achieving psychological safety:

- Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem.
- Acknowledge your own fallibility.
- Model curiosity and ask lots of questions.



## Fully Engaged Brains


We will succeed by accomplishing the mission through operating a well-made software system.

<p class="fragment">This is achieved through the combined brainpower of the team.</p>

<li>⛏️ Digging a ditch with shovels: we need your muscles. 💪</li>
<li class="fragment">⌨ Data entry: we need your eyes or ears and your fingers. 🖐</li>
<li class="fragment">👩‍💻 Software development: we need your brains. 🧠</li>
</ul>


In software development, what do we do if we have to do the same thing again?

## Eustress


<i>[eustress](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eustress)</i> : a positive form of stress having a beneficial effect on health, motivation, performance, and emotional well-being.


🥅 You perform better at a competition when you care about succeeding.<br />😤 Eustress instead of no stress 🥱.

<p class="fragment">😩 Anxiety and too much pressure to win can lead to choking and panic (distress). 😨</p>


Flow is the ["ultimate eustress experience – the epitome of eustress."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress#Flow)


> Flow is an extremely productive state in which an individual experiences their prime performance. The core elements are absorption, enjoyment and intrinsic motivation.



## Recipe for Success

We want individuals to enjoy their work and find it motivating.

Software development is a team activity. Our teammates matter.

How we communicate and work together matters.

We need to enable every team member to fully engage.
