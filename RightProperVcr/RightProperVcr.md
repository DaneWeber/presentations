# Right Proper VCR



## Testing is a feedback loop.


Feedback loops are better when they are
- Relevant
- Low-Latency


Relevance:
- Fail where the real system fails
- Succeed where the real system succeeds
- Low noise/false positives
- Important failures look important


Low-Latency:
- Instant feedback is the ideal
- Delays in each stage of the feedback loop degrade the relevance



## VCR provides some great trade-offs

- Records real API calls to other services.<br />(High Relevance)
- Replays the recordings as a mock.<br />(Low Latency)


To get the most benefit, you need to re-record the tapes frequently.

```
erase_vcr:
    find spec/vcr ! -type d -delete

update_specs: erase_vcr specs
```

<p class="fragment">`make update_specs` fails miserably<br />for eve-cases-v30.</p>


Every minute that goes by is latency that degrades the quality of the tapes, leaving us passing tests that give false confidence.

<p class="fragment">It's kinda like a security camera showing you stale footage.</p>


This makes Dane sad.

Re-recording fails for two reasons:
1. Some tapes have been manually edited, making them simple mocks.
2. Some tapes require cases be manually created and progressed prior to recording.



## One solution to both problems


```Ruby
let(:example_case) {
  TestCase.new(i9: PAYLOAD_OVERRIDE,
               role: :agent,
               status: :CONFIRM_DETAILS)
}

let(:case_number) { example.case_number }
```


Let's create a helper class that authenticates, creates cases, and moves them through the process so that we can easily specify what we need for a test to pass.
