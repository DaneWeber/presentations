# Dane's Agile Coaching



## I'm here to coach


There are many expectations for 🏉 "Scrum Master" and 🚤 "Agile Coach."
<p class="fragment">There are also many ways of _being_ those things.</p>
<p class="fragment">**What do _you_ expect of a coach?**</p>


"A good Scrum Master is always on the verge of being fired." —Ken Schwaber


My responsibility is to help improve:

- Organization
- Product Owner
- Team
- Technical Practices


![Scrum Master focus over time from LeSS](https://less.works/img/structure/scrum-master-focus-over-time.png)


I should _not_ be essential to the value stream's operation (getting from idea to working-in-production).

<p class="fragment">My focus is improving how the work is done.</p>


Think of a 🏈 football or ⚽ soccer coach: I'm not on the field. I'm observing and advising.

I don't have 🐺 silver bullets, I have feedback loops:

<ul><li>transparency -> inspection -> adaptation</li>
<li class="fragment">reduce latency, reduce noise, increase frequency, increase signal</li>
<li class="fragment">building the right thing & building the thing right & how</li>
<li class="fragment">code, tests, logging, monitoring, alerting, resilience, plans, business value, stakeholder satisfaction, user behavior, team collaboration, etc.</li></ul>



## I expect the team to be responsible, motivated, and disciplined

### Motivated


I'm hoping for intrinsic motivation

See [Dan Pink's "Drive"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)

Want to

- learn
- get better
- work together
- try new things


🛑 Let me know if there's something getting in the way of your intrinsic motivation.

🚧 I want to remove that impediment.


### Disciplined Professionalism


You are trusted<br />to act in the best interests of our clients.

<p class="fragment">Do it the right way. Do it well.</p>


There are often options, and we should present those with trade-offs everyone can understand.


Do you want a washable K&N air filter? Or just stick to the standard disposable air filters?

Doing a bad job is not an option.*


🛢 Should a mechanic give you the option of driving away without oil?

<p class="fragment">🩺 Should a doctor ask whether you want hands to be washed and all surgical tools removed after the surgery?</p>


🔩 Mechanics replacing all of the nuts and bolts, putting protective floormats in, and using funnels is just part of the deal.

<p class="fragment">🧰 As is keeping the shop floor clean, tools organized, and lift in working order.</p>

<p class="fragment">🧼 Surgeons washing their hands, retrieving all of their tools, and keeping the operating room clean is just part of the deal.</p>


👩‍💻 Writing DRY, easily understood, well-tested code is just part of the deal.

<p class="fragment">🧪 Updating dependencies, pair-programming, code reviews, refactoring, and automated tests are just part of the deal.</p>



## I want to make things better and better


### Five Ideals:

1. 🦠 Locality and Simplicity
2. 🎯 Focus, Flow, and Joy
3. 🪓 Improvement of Daily Work
4. 🦺 Psychological Safety
5. 🔮 Customer Focus


#### 1) 🦠 Locality and Simplicity

- Does it take 50 teams across five continents and 15 systems to coordinate to make a small change?
- Congruent architecture and organization that minimizes hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination.
- Also applies to code organization and data movement.
- Reduce complexity to reduce risk and waste.


#### 2) 🎯 Focus, Flow, and Joy

- Work within the problem-space, rather than with tangential matters that get in the way.
- Rapidly go from idea to a change in production.
- Have a great time doing so.
- It helps to automate routine activities and get rapid feedback on work.


#### 3) 🪓 Improvement of Daily Work

- Stop the production line and make things better.
- It is more important to improve how we work now than just get work done.
- Improve as individual people; improve relationships; improve processes; improve tools; improve technology.
- Pay down technical debt by investing in technical excellence.


#### 4) 🦺 Psychological Safety

- Take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed.
- Say, “I don’t know.” -- Continuously learning.
- New ideas are welcomed.
- Failure is done in the open, examined blamelessly, and leads to growth.
- This is the biggest predictor of a team’s success.


#### 5) 🔮 Customer Focus

- Go learn what real users/customers/stakeholders need.
- Prioritize core over context, which means doing the things that provide the real value.
- This isn’t just one specialist’s job: we each need to understand the “why” of what we are doing so that we can make good trade-offs.
