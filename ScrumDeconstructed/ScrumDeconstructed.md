### ✍️ Commitment

To the goals and each other. The lynch-pin of Scrum: commitment removes hesitation and propels the team.

Builds upon Focus.


### 🔭 Focus

Align as a team to make the best progress toward the most valuable goal.

This focus comes from agreement built upon Open engagement.


### 🪟 Openness

Make things visible, inspectable, available to all.

This requires Courage.


### 🦁 Courage

Speak truth to power, do the right thing, make improvements, and tackle difficult work.

Courage is cultivated and sustained by Respect.


### 🤝 Respect

Value the expertise and responsibility of everyone, particularly the self-managing team.


### Why?

Why talk values first?



## 💎 Transparency<br />🔍 Inspection<br />🦠 Adaptation


### 💎 Transparency

- Make visible what matters (the work, product, plans, emergent process, etc.) to those doing the work and those receiving it.
- Requires openness and psychological safety for real transparency.


### 🔍 Inspection

- Examine work/product/plans/process/etc. in order to understand and inform decisions.
- Requires transparency.
- Kindness and blamelessness enable a deeper and truer understanding of contributing factors.


### 🦠 Adaptation

- Change the work/product/plans/process/etc. immediately/ASAP to better achieve goals.
- Must be informed by inspection.
- Ownership, empowerment and self-management enable adaption.

"Inspect & Adapt" is the core of Scrum.
