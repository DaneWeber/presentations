![Wikimedia Commons from https://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/scientific-management/](https://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Frederick-Winslow-Taylor.jpg)

Note:
- Frederick Winslow Taylor started "scientific management" in the 1880s
- This management approach has been highly influential throughout American corporations.

Note:
- Taylor started in a steel mill that relied on the individual expertise and decision-making of craftsmen.
- The workers each had their own way of doing the job. Taylor timed them and found that some methods were more productive and efficient than others.
- He introduced the idea that managers should do the thinking to find the best way to perform a job and the workers should focus solely laboring as instructed. In this way every worker would perform at the maximum level of productivity.


‚úÖ Positive legacy

- Experimenting and learning better ways to work.
- Investing in training.
- Aligning incentives and sharing profits with workers.


‚ùå Negative legacy

- Shutting off workers' brains.
- Micromanagement.
- Centralizing decision-making.
- Disempowering the doers.

Note:
Many modern management practices unwittingly trace their origins to Taylor's Scientific Management.



## üîÆ Customer Focus


‚ÄúThere is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.‚Äù

~ Peter F. Drucker

Note:
Are we really solving our customers' problems?


### 5) üîÆ Customer Focus

- Go learn what real customers/stakeholders need.
- Learn, communicate, and challenge the _why_.
- Prioritize core over context, which means doing the things that provide the real value.
- This isn‚Äôt just a specialist‚Äôs job: we each need to understand the _why_ of what we are doing so that we can make good trade-offs.



## ‚õë Psychological Safety


> Of the five key dynamics of effective teams that the researchers identified, psychological safety was by far the most important.

### Korean Air Flight 801<br />(Airplane Crash)

Note:
- Tragedy; 6 August 1997; 229 deaths; As always, there are many factors, including fatigue, training, outdated maps, and more.
- The flight crew suggested to the captain that he was making a mistake with his approach. They did not directly warn him.
- The first officer and flight engineer were required to challenge the captain if concerned, but did not, even though they were concerned.
- The crew finally objected six seconds before the crash.
- The first officer had the ability to take over the controls and abort the landing, but allowed the captain to continue flying, even during the final six seconds.


### 4) ‚õë Psychological Safety

- This is the biggest predictor of an engineering team‚Äôs success at Google.
- Take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed.
- Say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù -- Continuously learning.
- New ideas are welcomed.
- Failure is done in the open, examined blamelessly, and leads to growth.



## üî™ Improvement of Daily Work


<div style="font-size: 50%; padding: 0 15%">‚ÄúThere cannot be a more important thing for an engineer, for a product team, than to work on systems that drive our productivity.‚Äù</div>

‚ÄúSo I would, any day of the week, trade off features for our own productivity.‚Äù

<div style="font-size: 50%; padding: 0 15%">‚ÄúI want our best engineers to work on our engineering systems, so that we can later on come back and build all of the new concepts we want.‚Äù</div>

Note:
- 1980's NUMMI story: Toyota turning GM's worst workforce around to produce cars with the fewest defects and considerable cost savings.
- Old rule: never stop the line. It cost the company $15k per minute when the line was stopped. People would fall into a pit or have a heart attack and the line would keep running; the people had to wait.
- Stop the line and fix a problem. ~1000 per shift; ~10% stop the line more than 30 seconds; ~1/month stop the line for over an hour ($1 million).


### Near Death Experiences

Due to technical debt

- Ebay (1999)
- Microsoft (2002)
- Google (2005)
- Amazon (2004)
- Twitter (2008)
- LinkedIn (2009)
- Etsy (2009)


### 3) üî™ Improvement of Daily Work

- Improving how we work over doing the work.
- Stop the production line and make things better.
- Improve as individual people; improve relationships; improve processes; improve tools; improve technology.
- Reduce technical impediments and risks by investing in technical excellence.
- Might need a ‚Äúfeature freeze.‚Äù



## üéØ Focus, Flow, and Joy


‚ÄúIn product development, our greatest waste is not unproductive engineers, but work products sitting idle in process queues.‚Äù

~ Donald G. Reinertsen,<br />_The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development_


![Simple value stream map from https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/discover/practice_value_stream_mapping](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/images/practices/simple-value-stream-map.png)

Note:
- When you map out the development process, you find that the vast majority of the cycle time is made of delays.
- This is fractal: as you dig down you find many tiny delays within what is an overall value-adding activity, such as the time it takes to rebuild the code or the time spent on a dead-end.


![Complex process diagram from https://www.process.st/business-process-modeling/](https://www.process.st/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/154146e.jpg)

Note:
- At Freddie Mac, it was amazing how difficult it was for developers to do their job.
- The multiple layers of hierarchy and planning and meetings consumed a huge amount of time.
- Even getting to the point of writing a line of code involved multiple approvals and jumping through special VPN connections to use a janky VM for editing code.


### 2) üéØ Focus, Flow, and Joy

- Work within the problem-space, rather than with tangential matters that get in the way.
- Rapidly go from idea to a change in production.
- Have a great time doing so.
- It helps to automate routine activities and get rapid feedback on work.



## ü¶† Locality and Simplicity


‚ÄúOrder can emerge from the bottom up, as opposed to being directed, with a plan, from the top down.‚Äù

~ General Stanley McChrystal, U.S. Army, Retired,<br />_Team of Teams_


### Team of Teams

Note:
- Joint Special Forces Task Force in Iraq in 2004 combating Al Qaeda Iraq.
- The task force had the best of everything, but they were losing to far smaller opponent that was nimble.
- Operations and Intelligence teams had no direct contact and information flowed through the hierarchy on a need-to-know basis.
- The solution involved "shared consciousness" and "empowered execution" where information flowed freely and action did not wait on the commander's approval.
- Pushed decision-making down to the very edges.


### 1) ü¶† Locality and Simplicity

- Congruent architecture and organization that minimizes hand-offs, bottlenecks, and coordination.
- Empower the doers to act directly based on shared purpose and understanding.
- Applies to organizational structure, code organization, and data movement.
- Reduce complexity to reduce risk and waste.
