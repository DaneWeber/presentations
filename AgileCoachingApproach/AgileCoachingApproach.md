Coaching Presentation
What's the take-away? Why am I here? How does this affect them?
I'm here to coach
There are many expectations for "Scrum Master" and "Agile Coach." There are also many ways of _being_ those things.
Interactive: What do you think a coach is?
"A good Scrum Master is always on the verge of being fired." --Ken Schwaber

Technical Practices
I should not be essential to the value stream's operation
My focus is improving how the work is done
Think of a football or soccer coach: I'm not on the field. I'm observing and advising.

I don't have silver bullets, I have feedback loops:
transparency -> inspection -> adaptation
reduce latency, reduce noise, increase frequency, increase signal
building the right thing & building the thing right & how
code, tests, logging, monitoring, alerting, resilience, plans, business value, stakeholder satisfaction, user behavior, team collaboration, etc. 
I expect the team to be responsible, motivated, and disciplined
