# Smooth Flow of Value



## Build the Right Thing

vs. Build it Right


Acceptance Criteria and most automated tests are about "building it right."

Did we build it as intended?


More important is that what we build matters.

We don't want to build a well-crafted bannana slicer.



## Value vs. Work


We talk about "business value" as what we want _User Stories_ to deliver.

Business value isn't just new functionality. It includes performance, security, usability, and more.

"Business value" is "whatever the business values," which should be whatever makes the product fit for purpose.


Example:

v1.42.1 of VS Code works in a certain way with a set of features that I want.

Why would I want to upgrade to v.1.42.2? It should be something that is better for me, the user of VS Code.

That could be a
- new feature
- bug fix
- security patch
- UI tweak
- performance improvement
- etc.


If VS Code listed in their release notes:
- Created a bunch of new objects
- Data model re-organized
- Renamed internal variables
- Imported libraries for future use

Are any of these worth upgrading for?


There is work is necessary for delivering value, but the work isn't the value.
