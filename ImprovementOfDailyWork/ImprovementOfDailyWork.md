- Stop the production line and make things better.
- It is more important to improve how we work now than just get work done.
- Improve as individual people; improve relationships; improve processes; improve tools; improve technology.
- Pay down technical debt by investing in technical excellence.



### Four types of work

- Business projects (delivering direct customer value)
- IT Operations projects (infrastructure and operations to accomplish business projects)
- Changes (updates, maintenance, and improvements required or inspired by the first two)
- Unplanned work (defects, incidents, and other problems generated by the above)

Process improvements pay off going forward. Errors/miscommunication/etc. compounds going forward.



### Retrospectives


Inspect and adapt _everything_.


#### Post-Incident Reviews

Blameless. Find the contributing factors.

- How can we know sooner?
- How can we recover sooner?
- How can we avoid similar incidents?

### Technical debt


_Technical debt_ is a metaphor for the shortcuts, onerous designs, and outdated technology that make modifying the system difficult and risky.

Like _financial debt_ it compounds and accumulates over time and has ongoing costs until it is paid off.


_Technical debt_ is worse than _financial debt_.

- Not fungible; unique to the system.
- Cannot outrun; must fix or replace.
- Does not have predictable costs.

It is _compounding risk_.
