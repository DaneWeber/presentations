# Scrum Deconstructed


We've all had some experience with Scrum

I don't know that I've ever seen a team follow it to the letter.


Scrum is a lightweight framework.

The whole thing is short and [available online](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).


It's not the only way to be Agile and there are many beneficial ways to adapt or modify it.

The majority of the modifications I've seen have been detrimental and have been premature optimizations.


What matters the most?



## Values


Scrum includes a set of roles, artifacts, and events.

You can schedule the events, name some artifacts, and give people titles that match the roles, and still get zero benefit.


Scrum requires a self-managing team, defined as:

> The team is responsible for executing the tasks **and** monitoring and managing process and progress.


Self-management entails freedom *and* responsibility.

Self-management requires a certain mindset among the team and the organization around the team.


<div style="text-align: left; margin: auto; width: 60%;">
Commitment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">⬆️ Focus</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">⬆️ Openness</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">⬆️ Courage</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">⬆️ Respect</span>
</div>


### ✍️ Commitment

To self-management. To the goals and each other. The lynch-pin of Scrum: commitment removes hesitation and propels the team.

Builds upon Focus.

Note: It is up to the team to make progress and enforce the process. Relates to Ownership.


### 🔭 Focus

Align as a team to make the best progress toward the most valuable goal.

This focus comes from agreement built upon Open engagement.

Note: The artifacts inform where to focus.


### 🪟 Openness

Make things visible, inspectable, available to all.

This requires Courage.


### 🦁 Courage

Speak truth to power, do the right thing, make improvements, and tackle difficult work.

Courage is cultivated and sustained by Respect.

Note: Ownership


### 🤝 Respect

Value the expertise and responsibility of everyone, particularly the self-managing team.

Note: Kindness


The lack of any of these values can undermine the success of a Scrum team.



## 💎 Transparency<br />🔍 Inspection<br />🦠 Adaptation


### 💎 Transparency

- Make visible what matters (the work, product, plans, emergent process, etc.) to those doing the work and those receiving it.
- Requires openness and psychological safety for real transparency.


### 🔍 Inspection

- Examine work/product/plans/process/etc. in order to understand and inform decisions.
- Requires transparency.
- Kindness and blamelessness enable a deeper and truer understanding of contributing factors.


### 🦠 Adaptation

- Change the work/product/plans/process/etc. immediately/ASAP to better achieve goals.
- Must be informed by inspection.
- Ownership, empowerment and self-management enable adaption.


💎🔍🦠

"Inspect & Adapt" is the core of Scrum.



## Artifacts, Events, and Roles


Three artifacts for transparency:

<div style="display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 1fr);
grid-column-gap: 0px;
grid-row-gap: 0px;
text-align: left;">
<div><strong>Artifact</strong></div><div><strong>Makes Visible</strong></div>
<div style="background: gray;">Product Increment</div><div style="background: gray;">📦 the product</div>
<div>Product Backlog</div><div>📅 the medium-term plan</div>
<div style="background: gray;">Sprint Backlog</div><div style="background: gray;">🕐 the short-term plan</div>
</div>


Four events to inspect & adapt:

<div style="display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
grid-template-rows: repeat(5, 1fr);
grid-column-gap: 0px;
grid-row-gap: 0px;
text-align: left;">
<div><strong>Event</strong></div><div><strong>Inspects & Adapts</strong></div>
<div style="background: gray;">Sprint Review</div><div style="background: gray;">📦 the product</div>
<div>Sprint Planning</div><div>📅 the medium-term plan</div>
<div style="background: gray;">Daily Scrum</div><div style="background: gray;">🕐 the short-term plan</div>
<div>Sprint Retrospective</div><div>🌐 any & everything</div>
</div>


Three roles to accomplish this:

<div style="display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 1fr);
grid-column-gap: 0px;
grid-row-gap: 0px;
text-align: left;">
<div><strong>Role</strong></div><div><strong>Focus</strong></div>
<div style="background: gray;">Product Owner</div><div style="background: gray;">📶 Maximizing Value</div>
<div>Developers</div><div>🥇 Quality Work</div>
<div style="background: gray;">Scrum Masters</div><div style="background: gray;">🏉 Team Effectiveness</div>
</div>



## Take-Aways


1. Values & Self-Management
2. Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation
3. Small Batches (Increment)
4. Ordered (Sequence)
5. Learn and Respond (Iterate)
6. Accelerate and Amplify Feedback Loops
7. Maintain Stable Intermediary States
