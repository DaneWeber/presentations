Note:
Are we really solving our customers' problems?


- Go learn what real users/customers/stakeholders need.
- Prioritize core over context, which means doing the things that provide the real value.
- This isn’t just one specialist’s job: we each need to understand the “why” of what we are doing so that we can make good trade-offs.

Note:
- Tragedy; 6 August 1997; 229 deaths; As always, there are many factors, including fatigue, training, outdated maps, and more.
- The flight crew suggested to the captain that he was making a mistake with his approach. They did not directly warn him.
- The first officer and flight engineer were required to challenge the captain if concerned, but did not, even though they were concerned.
- The crew finally objected six seconds before the crash.
- The first officer had the ability to take over the controls and abort the landing, but allowed the captain to continue flying, even during the final six seconds.


- Take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed.
- Say, “I don’t know.” -- Continuously learning.
- New ideas are welcomed.
- Failure is done in the open, examined blamelessly, and leads to growth.
- This is the biggest predictor of a team’s success.

- Also applies to code organization and data movement.
