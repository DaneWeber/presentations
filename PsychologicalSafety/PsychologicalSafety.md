Innovation work:

Google studied their teams to find what ingredients led to effectiveness and high-performing teams.

>Psychological safety was far and away the most important of the five dynamics we found -- it’s the underpinning of the other four. How could that be? Taking a risk around your team members seems simple. But remember the last time you were working on a project. Did you feel like you could ask what the goal was without the risk of sounding like you’re the only one out of the loop? Or did you opt for continuing without clarifying anything, in order to avoid being perceived as someone who is unaware?

>Turns out, we’re all reluctant to engage in behaviors that could negatively influence how others perceive our competence, awareness, and positivity.


- Take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed.
- Say, “I don’t know.” -- Continuously learning.
- New ideas are welcomed.
- Failure is done in the open, examined blamelessly, and leads to growth.
- This is the biggest predictor of a team’s success.


Advice from Google for achieving psychological safety:

- Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem.
- Acknowledge your own fallibility.
- Model curiosity and ask lots of questions.


## Fully Engaged Brains


Success: Accomplishing the mission by operating a well-made software system.

<p class="fragment">This is achieved through the combined brainpower of the team.</p>


- Digging a ditch with shovels: we need your muscles.
- Data entry: we need your eyes or ears and your fingers.
- Software development: we need your brains.


In software development, what do we do if we have to do the same thing again?

<p class="fragment">Copy Paste</p>
<p class="fragment">We automate routine work.</p>


We are engaged in creative problem-solving.


You can still help dig a ditch while you're zoned out and letting your mind wander.

You might be able to continue data entry while thinking about other things.

Writing user stories, coding a solution, reading error logs, and helping with nearly any system development activity requires engaging your brain.



## Eustress


<i>[eustress](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eustress)</i> : a positive form of stress having a beneficial effect on health, motivation, performance, and emotional well-being.


You perform better at a competition when you care about succeeding (eustress instead of no stress).

Anxiety and too much pressure to win can lead to choking and panic (distress).


Flow is the ["ultimate eustress experience – the epitome of eustress."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress#Flow)

> Flow is an extremely productive state in which an individual experiences their prime performance. The core elements are absorption, enjoyment and intrinsic motivation.



## Recipe for Success

We want individuals to enjoy their work and find it motivating.

Software development is a team activity. Our teammates matter.

How we communicate and work together matters.


We need to enable every team member to fully engage.
